# cpp-neural-exercise
This project aims at providing an opportunity to do basic C++ programming exercise by implementing simple neural networks from scratch.<br>
The exercise does NOT include any complex algorithmic problems, and instead we can try
* implementing basic matrix operations,

* deriving equations for tranining simple neural networks, or in other words, computing partial derivatives by using a pen, and

* implementing a typical training procedure in a naive manner.

In practice, it would be great to use very useful frameworks like Chainer and Tensorflow!

Note: The Matrix class implementation (e.g., the function names) respects the <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a> library.

Detailed instruction will come soon.
